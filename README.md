# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project implements an Email Spam Classification system using the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm, a probabilistic model well-suited for text classification tasks. The goal of the project is to automatically distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) emails using Natural Language Processing techniques.

The system follows a complete machine learning pipeline, including text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, stopword removal), tokenization, and feature extraction using Bag of Words / TF-IDF vectorization. The processed data is then used to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for efficient and reliable spam detection.

Model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and Precision, highlighting the model’s effectiveness in correctly identifying spam emails while minimizing false positives.

This project demonstrates:

Practical implementation of an end-to-end ML workflow

Application of NLP techniques for real-world text classification

Understanding of probabilistic learning models

Performance evaluation of classification systems

It serves as a foundational project in machine learning and showcases the application of statistical methods to solve real-world filtering problems.
